1. Load image in jpg format, converts it to grayscale with
using GPU and write to a new file.
2. Load image in jpg format, converts it to grayscale with
using the CPU and write to a new file.
3. Convert a large number of images with both methods. Record it
are the average conversion times.
4. Source code must:

   -  contain module header with module description, author's name and licence
    
   -  be comprehensive and well documented
    
   -  each function (class and its methods) must have docstring in PEP 257
    
   -  PEP 8 
5. Write documentation. In the documentation, include information about the assignment, instructions for starting and
